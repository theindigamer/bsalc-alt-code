# Build Systems Ã  la Carte (Rust-like syntax)

I saw a tweet mention that Haskell's syntax made the code examples in
the paper hard to follow for those unfamiliar with it :frowning_face:.
I really liked the paper; it'd be awesome if more people could understand
what's going on better. Hence this translation to Rust-like syntax! :smile:

If you're having trouble understanding something, or have some suggestions
for improvement, or just have some Haskell-specific question related to the
paper, please open an issue! Vaguely worded issues are perfectly okay too!
